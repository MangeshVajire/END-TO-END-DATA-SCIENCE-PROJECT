*END-TO-END-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT*

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: MANGESH VAJIRE

INTERN ID : CT08UBW

DOMAIN : DATA SCIENCE

DURATION: 4 WEEEKS

MENTOR: NILA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION : 

This data science project consists of several key components.
The main component is an Insurance Pricing Forecast model that implements linear regression to predict insurance premiums based on age,
using synthetic data with 1000 samples and visualizing results through matplotlib.
The project also includes an improved image classification model using PyTorch for CIFAR-10 dataset classification,
featuring batch normalization, dropout layers, and comprehensive visualization tools. Additionally,
it contains a robust data preprocessing pipeline that handles both numerical and categorical data with proper scaling and encoding capabilities
. The project also implements an optimization solution for furniture production using linear programming to maximize profit while considering resource constraints.
Each component demonstrates proper software engineering practices with clear documentation, error handling, and visualization capabilities
The codebase shows a good understanding of machine learning, deep learning, data preprocessing, and optimization techniques, making it a comprehensive data science project.

RESOURCES : 

Based on the project files, the following resources and libraries are used:

1. Data Analysis: pandas and numpy for data manipulation and numerical operations
2. Machine Learning: scikit-learn for implementing LinearRegression model
3. Deep Learning: PyTorch and torchvision for CNN implementation and CIFAR-10 dataset
4. Visualization: matplotlib and seaborn for plotting results and creating visualizations
5. Optimization: PuLP library for linear programming optimization
6. Additional utilities: Python standard libraries for file handling and system operations

   USES :

   The Insurance Pricing Forecast script demonstrates several key uses:
   
   1) It shows how to implement a basic linear regression model for predicting insurance premiums based on age
   2) It provides a practical example of synthetic data generation for insurance pricing models
   3)  3) It demonstrates data visualization techniques using matplotlib to compare actual vs predicted premiums
   4) It showcases model evaluation by splitting data into training and testing sets
   5) It serves as a learning tool for understanding the relationship between age and insurance premiums in a simplified context.
